This money was deposited in a box in my name, as my master was being secretive with his name, as the South African government of Thambo Mbeki is in support of President Mugabe's actions. The box is labeled as gemstones. My master had planned to use this money  for the purchase of lands, new machines and chemicals for establishment of new farms in Botswana.

      "{List directory contents} When I was younger, I'd get so frustrated at those games where you'd have to pick out all of the subtle differences between two pictures. I'd always end up with one or two that I just could never see. When I want to do the same type of comparison between two directories on my computer, I use Directory Lister and I never miss a thing. Not only does Directory Lister display the contents of your chosen directories, it will also let you save the output to an HTML file. This is great for web developers who want a quick way to list the contents of a ZIP file before archiving it and uploading it to their website.

I COULD forget about the site and maybe somehow encounter it later, or I COULD drop the site into Web Calendar and have this handy-dandy app remind me to check the page again in a week. The same technique holds true for my normal browsing... for example, I can use Web Calendar to remind me to check out the Digital Media newsletter every morning, or to check Amazon for a CD that I know will be released in a week.

      "I am a sucker for keyboard shortcuts. Anything that can save me from using the mouse is good in my book. Occasionally I like to view the web or Windows Explorer in Full Screen mode... to do this I just hit F11 on the keyboard and there I am in Full Screen mode. Hit it again and I am back to regular mode. If you aren't as much of a fan of keyboard shortcuts as me, then all you have to do is press and hold the Ctrl key while clicking on the Maximize button and you will have the same effect. You will notice, however, that your Start Menu isn't anywhere to be seen. Never fear, another keyboard shortcut is here... just press Ctrl key plus the Esc key and your Start Menu will be back where it belongs. Alternatively, if you have a Windows key on your keyboard you can use that key to bring up your Start Menu as well.\n",

      "Our Latest Discovery: XRMD - Several investment reporters featured XrayMedia during fiscal 2001/02. At the time, we felt that the advertising industry created a huge opportunity for the company's direct sourcing technology solutions, and so far the company has delivered. Although the company has raised just $2 million in the two years it has been developing its technology, it has increased revenues sources dramatically by opening a financial services division expanding the Live Media Marketplace expected revenues to $3-5 mm during fiscal 2003, driving the line in 2004 to $15- 25 mm. This remarkable growth becomes more understandable when one views the savings that its direct sourcing model generates for advertisers and retailers. The company saves advertising buyers up to 70% in costs dramatically increasing wholesale pricing effect, by saving time & efforts, cutting telephone and faxing bills, while providing free mass sourcing opportunities for negotiating advertising buying and selling opportunities using a secure state of the art real time negotiating technology over the Internet, weve never seen anything like it!\n",

She could be gracious, disdainful, insolent, or confiding at will. Her apparent good nature was real; she had no temptation to descend to malignity. But at each moment her mood changed; she was full of confidence or craft; her moving tenderness would give place to a heart-breaking hardness and insensibility. Yet how paint her as she was, without bringing together all the extremes of feminine nature? In a word, the Duchess was anything that she wished to be or to seem. Her face was slightly too long. There was a grace in it, and a certain thinness and fineness that recalled the portraits of the Middle Ages. Her skin was white, with a faint rose tint. Everything about her erred, as it were, by an excess of delicacy.  -->\n",

A moment after this, there was a knock at my door, and this same man entered. It was W----, the poet of nature, who is only a poor tailor, but who has a truly poetical mind. Rellstab and others in Berlin have mentioned him with honor; there is something healthy in his poems, among which several of a sincerely religious character may be found. He had read that I was in Berlin, and wished now to visit me. We sat together on the sofa and conversed: there was such an amiable contentedness, such an unspoiled and good tone of mind about him, that I was sorry not to be rich in order that I might do something for him. I was ashamed of offering him the little that I could give; in any case I wished to put it in as agreeable a form as I could. I asked him whether I might invite him to hear Jenny Lind.  -->\n",

And after waiting for two hours, the cry of All tickets are sold! rang not unfrequently in the ears of disappointed students.

      "What is MIME?\n",
      "\n",
      "MIME stands for \"Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions\".  It is the\n",
      "standard for how to send multipart, multimedia, and binary data using the\n",
      "world-wide Internet email system.  Typical uses of MIME include sending\n",
      "images, audio, wordprocessing documents, programs, or even plain text\n",
      "files when it is important that the mail system does not modify any part\n",
      "of the file.  MIME also allows for labelling message parts so that a\n",
      "recipient (or mail program) may determine what to do with them. \n",
      "\n",
      "How can I read a MIME message?\n",
      "\n",
      "Since MIME is only a few years old, there are still some mailers in use\n",
      "which do not understand MIME messages.  However, there are a growing\n",
      "number of mail programs that have MIME support built-in.  (One popular\n",
      "MIME-capable mailer for Unix, VMS and PCs is Pine, developed at the\n",
      "University of Washington and available via anonymous FTP from the host\n",
      "ftp.cac.washington.edu in the file /pine/pine.tar.Z)\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, several proprietary email systems provide MIME translation\n",
      "capability in their Internet gateway products.  However, even if you do\n",
      "not have access to a MIME-capable mailer or suitable gateway, there is\n",
      "still hope! \n",
      "\n",
      "There are a number of stand-alone programs that can interpret a MIME\n",
      "message.  One of the more versatile is called \"munpack\".  It was developed\n",
      "at Carnegie Mellon University and is available via anonymous FTP from the\n",
      "host ftp.andrew.cmu.edu in the directory pub/mpack/.  There are versions\n",
      "available for Unix, PC, Mac and Amiga systems.  For compabibility with\n",
      "older forms of transferring binary files, the munpack program can also\n",
      "decode messages in split-uuencoded format. \n",
      "\n",
      "Does MIME replace UUENCODE?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes.  UUENCODE has been used for some time for encoding binary files so\n",
      "that they can be sent via Internet mail, but it has several technical\n",
      "limitations and interoperability problems.  MIME uses a more robust\n",
      "encoding called \"Base64\" which has been carefully designed to survive the\n",
      "message transformations made by certain email gateways. \n",
      "\n",
      "How can I learn more about MIME?\n",

      "  Sun Micro Outlines Roadmap for Managing Networks \n",
      "  Friday September 20, 5:00 am ET \n",
      "  By Peter Henderson \n",
      "\n",
      "  SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Computer maker Sun Microsystems Inc. on Thursday\n",
      "  said it would create in a few years a network environment that will be as\n",
      "  straightforward to handle as a single machine, a strategy it calls N1.\n",
      "\n",
      "  It laid out a road map for a new layer of intelligent software and systems that will meld\n",
      "  unwieldy networks into easy-to-use systems, a goal similar to those of most rivals\n",
      "  making computers which manage networks. \n",
      "  EMC Corp. announced this week software aimed at allowing users to manage storage\n",
      "  resources as a pool. Hewlett-Packard Co has a Utility Data Center, designed for\n",
      "  broader management. International Business Machines Corp's project eLiza is working\n",
      "  to make computers \"self-healing\" when systems break.\n",
      "\n",
      "  \"Applications still have to run zeroes and ones on some computing engine but the\n",
      "  whole idea behind N1 is you stop thinking about that. You don't think about what box\n",
      "  it is running on,\" Sun Vice President Steve MacKay, head of the N1 program, said in an\n",
      "  interview on the sidelines of a Sun user conference. \n",
      "\n",
      "  Many industry executives see computer power eventually being sold like power or\n",
      "  water, as a utility that can be turned on or off, in whatever volume one wants whenever\n",
      "  needed. \n",
      "  For that to happen computers must be tied together seamlessly, rather than cobbling\n",
      "  them together with tenuous links, as most networks do today, experts say. There are\n",
      "  still major barriers, though, such as communications standards for machines from\n",
      "  different vendors to interoperate closely. \n",
      "  Sun promised to deliver a \"virtualization engine\" that would let administrators look at\n",
      "  their entire network as a pool by the end of the year. Network administrators today\n",
      "  often have no automatic system to report what is in the network. \n",
      "\n",
      "  \"It'll tell you what you have and how it is laid out,\" promised MacKay\n",
      "  The second stage, beginning in 2003, would allow users to identify a service, such as\n",
      "  online banking, and allocate resources for them with a few clicks, Sun said. \n",
      "  Finally, in 2004, Sun's software should allow networks to change uses of resources on\n",
      "  the fly in response to changing needs, such as a bank assuring quicker online response\n",
      "  time for priority users, the company said.\n",

      " emigrate to provincial Russia.\n",
      " \n",

      " \"The inhabitants of foggy Albion keen to travel could go to any Russian city\n",

      " \n",
      " The time for elevenses in Britain - perhaps the opportunity for a quiet cup of\n",
      " tea and a chocolate Hobnob - is known in Russia as the Wolf Hour.\n",
      " \n",
      " It was so named in Soviet times because at 11am a wolf appeared from the\n",
      " famous animal clock at the Obrasov Puppet Theatre in Moscow. It is also\n",
      " opening time in the nation's vodka shops.\n",
      " \n",
      " And the vodka, like all other spirits, is cheap. Kommersant pointed out that\n",

      " \n",
      " The whisky is cheap, however, because it is unlike anything the average Briton\n",

      " \n",

      " which they would like to live.\n",
      " \n",
      " France, the Russian paper claimed, was a country \"where English is only known\n",

      " that drop below -70C. Houses are built on concrete stilts because the\n",
      " permafrost makes digging foundations impossible.\n",
      " \n",
      " Again, the Russian paper had a word of reassurance. While acknowledging the\n",
      " climatic problems, it said that \"thanks to global warming this difficulty will\n",
      " solve itself\".\n",
      " \n",
      " Kommersant also had an answer to the labour crisis that would be created in\n",

      "       Socijalisticka partija Srbije, predvodjena grupom starih socijalista na celu sa Milomirem Minicem, konacno se odrekla politike i herojskog drzanja predsednika te stranke Slobodana Milosevica, saopstenjima, da jedan ,,slabo obavesten covek ne moze, pogotovu ne iz zatvorske celije upravljati tako velikom partijom kao sto je Socijalisticka partija Srbije, pa zvao se on i Slobodan Milosevic''.\n",
      "       Socijalisti koji za sebe danas kazu da vise nisu idolopoklonici Slobodana Milosevica, neprestano, u kontaktima sa clanovima i simpatizerima te partije, pokusavaju da razdvoje odbranu Slobodana Milosevica u Hagu, od politickog zivota u Srbiji, pripisujuci Milosevicevim braniocima iz nacionalnog komiteta za oslobadjanje S. Milosevica, ,,Sloboda'' da im je cilj da uniste Socijalisticku partiju Srbije.\n",
      "        Iako je zbog istih takvih gledista, svojevremeno najpolularniji socijalista, posle predsednika te stranke, prof. Branislav Ivkovic bio iskljucen iz redova SPS, danas rukovodstvo SPS koristi jos teze i grublje kvalifikacije na racun njihovog predsednika, pritom ne strahujuci da bi bilo ko od njih mogao biti iskljucen iz partije.\n",
      "        Ne retko se poslednjih dana, u rokovodstvu partije cuje da partija nije Slobodan Milosevic, i da on ne predstvalja tu partiju, vec da su partija Rukovodstvo i Glavni odbor te stranke.\n",
      "        Medjutim u clanstvu i medju simpatizerima te stranke, stvari se ne odijaju bas po planovima rukovodstva.\n",
      "        Procene idu dotle da se na septembarskim izborima ocekuje da Bata Zivojinovic osvoji tek 1% glasova.  Clanovi partije, najveci deo njih i danas veruje svom heroju, Slobodanu Milosevicu.\n",
      "        Po clanstvu partije, ovih dana u rukovodstvu partije, oni koji su predsednika te stranke pogresno informisali poslednjih godina, kada su shvatili da im je ,,odzvonilo'' pokusavaju da sacuvaju sebe eliminacijom predsednika Slobodana Milosevica.\n",
      "        Mladi socijalisti, kojih i nema bas mnogo, kako se SPS svojevremeno hvalio, izgleda su na strani predsednika te stranke. Tako se u nastupima na opstinskim odborima, mogu cuti uverljivi govori Dejana Stjepanovica i Igora Raicevica, i po neki Milinka Isakovica iz redova mladih socijalista, clanova organizaciono politickog odbora predsednika SPS. \n",
      "        Obracanja ovih mladih ljudi, medju clanstvom partije imaju do deset puta vecu tezuni, nego li obracanja profesionalnih politicara koji za sobom vuku teret proslosti.\n",
      "         Stav rukovodstva mladih socijalista, se razlikuje od stava saveta mladih, koji su takodje na strani predsednika. \n",
      "         Branko Ruzic i Dejan Backovic, svojevremeno najveci branioci i zastupnici lika i dela Slobodana Milosevica, danas su se pretvorili u njegove najvece kriticare. Pokusavaju na sve moguce nacine da minorizuju grupu mladih koja ga podrzava.\n",
      "         Cak se poslednjih dana cuje, da je najbolji recept da se rukovodstvo mladih odrzi ikao je protiv Sloba, da se povezu rodbinskim vezama, pa se tako predsednik mladih socijalista Beograda, Ana Djurovic udala za Branka Ruzica, predsednika Mladih socijalista Srbije, koji je za kuma uzeo Dejna Backovia, svog potpredsednika. Backovic se ovih dana zeni, jednom  mladom socijalistkinjom koja je clan saveta mladih, a u isto vreme i sestra jednog od clanova IO GO SPS-a, za kuma uzima jos jednog mladog socijalistu iz Saveta mladih. Sve u svemu, mladi u SPS se drze kao italijanske mafijaske porodice 60-tih u SAD.\n",
      "          Sta ce se do kraja price dogoditi ostaje pitanje, no clanstvo i simpatizeri ce oceniti rad svog rukovodstva na predsednickim izborima.\n",
      "          Pimato se samo, sta ce da rade, ako im Bata prodje losije od Seselja koga je predsednik Slobodan Milosevic podrzao za predsednickog kandidat?\n",

      "Systems Affected\n",
      "\n",
      "     * Systems running PHP versions 4.2.0 or 4.2.1\n",
      "\n",
      "Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "   A  vulnerability  has been discovered in PHP. This vulnerability could\n",
      "   be  used  by  a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or crash PHP\n",
      "   and/or the web server.\n",
      "\n",
      "I. Description\n",
      "\n",
      "   PHP  is  a  popular  scripting  language  in  widespread use. For more\n",
      "   information about PHP, see\n",
      "\n",
      "          http://www.php.net/manual/en/faq.general.php\n",
      "\n",
      "   The  vulnerability  occurs  in the portion of PHP code responsible for\n",
      "   handling  file uploads, specifically multipart/form-data. By sending a\n",
      "   specially  crafted  POST  request  to  the web server, an attacker can\n",
      "   corrupt  the  internal  data  structures used by PHP. Specifically, an\n",
      "   intruder  can  cause  an improperly initialized memory structure to be\n",
      "   freed.  In  most  cases, an intruder can use this flaw to crash PHP or\n",
      "   the  web  server. Under some circumstances, an intruder may be able to\n",
      "   take  advantage  of  this  flaw  to  execute  arbitrary  code with the\n",
      "   privileges of the web server.\n",
      "\n",
      "   You  may  be  aware that freeing memory at inappropriate times in some\n",
      "   implementations  of  malloc  and  free  does not usually result in the\n",
      "   execution  of  arbitrary  code.  However, because PHP utilizes its own\n",
      "   memory  management  system,  the  implementation of malloc and free is\n",
      "   irrelevant to this problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "   Stefan  Esser  of  e-matters  GmbH has indicated that intruders cannot\n",
      "   execute   code   on   x86   systems.   However,  we  encourage  system\n",
      "   administrators  to  apply  patches  on  x86  systems  as well to guard\n",
      "   against denial-of-service attacks and as-yet-unknown attack techniques\n",
      "   that may permit the execution of code on x86 architectures.\n",
      "\n",
      "   This  vulnerability  was discovered by e-matters GmbH and is described\n",
      "   in  detail  in  their  advisory.  The  PHP  Group  has  also issued an\n",
      "   advisory.  A list of vendors contacted by the CERT/CC and their status\n",
      "   regarding this vulnerability is available in VU#929115.\n",
      "\n",
      "   Although   this  vulnerability  only  affects  PHP  4.2.0  and  4.2.1,\n",
      "   e-matters  GmbH  has  previously  identified  vulnerabilities in older\n",
      "   versions  of  PHP.  If  you  are  running  older  versions  of PHP, we\n",
      "   encourage you to review\n",
      "   http://security.e-matters.de/advisories/012002.html\n",
      "\n",
      "II. Impact\n",
      "\n",
      "   A  remote  attacker can execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.\n",
      "   An  attacker  may not be able to execute code on x86 architectures due\n",
      "   to  the way the stack is structured. However, an attacker can leverage\n",
      "   this  vulnerability  to  crash PHP and/or the web server running on an\n",
      "   x86 architecture.\n",
      "\n",
      "III. Solution\n",
      "\n",
      "Apply a patch from your vendor\n",
      "\n",
      "   Appendix A contains information provided by vendors for this advisory.\n",

      "   Please contact your vendor directly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Upgrade to the latest version of PHP\n",
      "\n",
      "   If  a  patch  is  not  available  from your vendor, upgrade to version\n",
      "   4.2.2.\n",
      "\n",
      "Deny POST requests\n",
      "\n",
      "   Until  patches  or an update can be applied, you may wish to deny POST\n",
      "   requests.  The  following  workaround  is  taken from the PHP Security\n",
      "   Advisory:\n",
      "\n",
      "     If  the  PHP  applications on an affected web server do not rely on\n",
      "     HTTP POST input from user agents, it is often possible to deny POST\n",
      "     requests on the web server.\n",
      "\n",
      "     In  the  Apache  web server, for example, this is possible with the\n",
      "     following  code  included  in  the  main  configuration  file  or a\n",
      "     top-level .htaccess file:\n",
      "\n",

      "     Note  that an existing configuration and/or .htaccess file may have\n",
      "     parameters contradicting the example given above.\n",

      "Disable vulnerable service\n",
      "\n",
      "   Until  you  can upgrade or apply patches, you may wish to disable PHP.\n",
      "   As a best practice, the CERT/CC recommends disabling all services that\n",

      "The Squeeze KDE 4.4 update this week pulled down network-manager as a dependency.  In my case I much prefer wicd to handle my wireless.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The update had them both running simultaneously, which I didn't like at all.  I was plugged into my wired network, which wicd had set up as default, and network-manger connected to one of the wireless networks I had configured.  Both interfaces up, even two default routes.  Yuk.\n",
      "\n",
      "I didn't like the fact that the KDE update ignored my current install of wicd to install network-manager, and when I purged network-manager KDE worked (and continues to work) just fine.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the \"dependency\" on network-manager seems to be merely a preference of the KDE team.  To me that means I should not have seen network-manager if I already had wicd installed.  This is very similar to the various packages that insist they need avahi-daemon to work, and yet purging avahi-daemon doesn't break anything not using mDNS.\n",
      "\n",
      "So while Thomas could file a bug, I don't think it's not germane to complain about DDs putting everything under the sun into a dependency list.  Here's the place for the community to decide whether we really need to force an install of network-manager (or avahi) when they're not really needed, or decide that because some cases might require it everyone should have it.\n",

He might be in time for that, after seeing Mrs. Branston. That lady happened fortunately to be at home, and received Gilbert alone in her favourite back drawing-room, where he found her ensconced in that snug retreat made by the six-leaved Japanese screen, which formed a kind of temple on one side of the fire-place. There had been a final rupture between Adela and Mrs. Pallinson a few days before, and that matron, having shown her cards a little too plainly, had been routed by an unwonted display of spirit on the part of the pretty little widow. She was gone, carrying all her belongings with her, and leaving peace and liberty behind her. The flush of triumph was still upon Mrs. Branston; and this unexpected victory, brief and sudden in its occurrence, like most great victories, was almost a consolation to her for that disappointment which had stricken her so heavily of late.  -->\n",

For example, an American newspaper correspondent had written a dramatic description of the German army marching, marching steadily along a great Belgian high road--a procession without beginning and without end--and of the procession being halted for his benefit, and of a German officer therein who struck a soldier several times in the face angrily with his cane, while the man stood stiffly at attention.

      "He belonged to that small minority of undemonstrative retiring natures, who are always at peace with themselves, and who are conscious of a feeling of humiliation at the mere thought of making a request, no matter what its nature may be. So promotion had come to him tardily, and by virtue of the slowly-working laws of seniority. He had been made a sub-lieutenant in 1802, but it was not until 1829 that he became a major, in spite of the grayness of his moustaches. His life had been so blameless that no man in the army, not even the general himself, could approach him without an involuntary feeling of respect. It is possible that he was not forgiven for this indisputable superiority by those who ranked above him; but, on the other hand, there was not one of his men that did not feel for him something of the affection of children for a good mother. For them he knew how to be at once indulgent and severe. He himself had also once served in the ranks, and knew the sorry joys and gaily-endured hardships of the soldier's lot. He knew the errors that may be passed over and the faults that must be punished in his men--his children, as he always called them--and when on campaign he readily gave them leave to forage for provision for man and horse among the wealthier classes.  Master Pillsbury pursed his lips and his expression became severe.  Yes, I shall outlive it, else I should have little faith in myself. But I shall not forget; and if you would remain forever what you now are to me, you will so act that nothing may mar this memory, if it is to be no more. I doubt your power to forget an affection which has survived so many changes and withstood assaults such as Geoffrey must unconsciously have made upon it. But I have no right to condemn your beliefs, to order your actions, or force you to accept my code of morals if you are not ready for it. You must decide, but do not again deceive yourself, and through whatever comes hold fast to that which is better worth preserving than husband, happiness, or friend.  What's the price, asked Ellis, of the cigar and the compliment together? In other words, what do you want of me? \n",

      " by a new destroyer--a gentlemanly vulture, whose suave accents and perfect manners were fatal to the unwary. Henceforth Horatio Cromie Nugent Paget flourished and fattened upon the folly of his fellow-men. As promoter of joint-stock companies that never saw the light; as treasurer of loan-offices where money was never lent; as a gentleman with capital about to introduce a novel article of manufacture from the sale of which a profit of five thousand a year would infallibly be realized, and desirous to meet with another gentleman of equal capital; as the mysterious X.Y.Z. who will--for so small a recompense as thirty postage-stamps--impart the secret of an elegant and pleasing employment, whereby seven-pound-ten a-week may be made by any individual, male or female;--under every flimsy disguise with which the swindler hides his execrable form, Captain Paget plied his cruel trade, and still contrived to find fresh dupes. Of course there were occasions when the pigeons were slow to flutter into the fascinating snare, and when the vulture had a bad time of it; and it was a common thing for the Captain to sink from the splendour of Mayfair or St. James's-street into some dingy transpontine hiding-place. But he never went back to Tulliver's-terrace, though Mary Anne pleaded piteously for the payment of her poor mother's debt. When her husband was in funds, he patted her head affectionately, and told her that he would see about it--i.e. the payment of Mrs. Kepp's bill; while, if she ventured to mention the subject to him when his purse was scantily furnished, he would ask her fiercely how he was to satisfy her mother's extortionate claims when he had not so much as a sixpence for his own use. \n",

      "<code>ArrayList</code> and <code>LinkedList</code> are two <code>Collections</code> classes used for storing lists of object references. For example, you could have an <code>ArrayList</code> of Strings, or a <code>LinkedList</code> of Integers.

Note that the <code>get</code> method is implemented for <code>LinkedLists</code>, but it requires a sequential scan from the front or back of the list. This scan is very slow. For a <code>LinkedList</code>, there's no fast way to access the Nth element of the list.\n",

If the middle value is too high, then the upper half of the list is eliminated. However, if the middle value is too low, then the lower half of the list is ignored. This process continues until the key is found in the list, or until the lower bound of the search becomes greater than the upper bound.\n",

      "emotionally charged questions surrounding the deadly\n",
      "failures of the buildings. \n",

      "that amount, as the insurance companies say. \n",
      "\n",
      "As both sides have prepared their arguments, they have\n",

      "produced more than 1,700 pages of analysis and thousands of\n",

      "and owned the trade center and supports Mr. Silverstein in\n",

      "In a statement, the Port Authority said access to documents\n",

      "given the dissatisfaction with the first major inquiry into\n",
      "the buildings' collapse. That investigation, led by the\n",
      "Federal Emergency Management Agency, was plagued by few\n",
      "resources, a lack of access to crucial information like\n",
      "building plans, and infighting among experts and officials.\n",
      "A new federal investigation intended to remedy those\n",

      "\n",
      "With no shortage of money or expertise, investigations by\n",
      "both sides in the legal case have produced a startling body\n",
      "of science and theory, some of it relevant not only to the\n",
      "trade center disaster but to other skyscrapers as well. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"The work should be available to other investigators,\" said\n",

      "The scope of the investigation behind the scenes is vast by\n",

      "Associates, hired by Silverstein Properties, have called\n",
      "upon powerful computer programs, originally developed with\n",
      "the Pentagon for classified research, to create a model of\n",
      "the Sept. 11 attack from beginning to end. \n",
      "\n",
      "The result is a compilation of three-dimensional images of\n",
      "the severed exterior columns, smashed floor and damaged\n",
      "core of the towers, beginning with the impacts and\n",
      "proceeding up to the moments of collapse. Those images -\n",
      "which Mr. Levy is not allowed to release - have helped\n",
      "pinpoint the structural failures. \n",
      "\n",
      "The FEMA investigators did not have access to such computer\n",
      "modeling. Nor did the FEMA team have unfettered access to\n",
      "the trade center site, with all its evidence, in the weeks\n",
      "immediately after the attacks. But no such constraints\n",
      "hampered engineers at LZA/Thornton-Tomasetti, brought to\n",
      "the site for emergency work beginning on the afternoon of\n",
      "Sept. 11. Daniel A. Cuoco, the company president and a\n",
