This money was deposited in a box in my name, as my master was being secretive with his name, as the South African government of Thambo Mbeki is in support of President Mugabe's actions. The box is labeled as gemstones. My master had planned to use this money  for the purchase of lands, new machines and chemicals for establishment of new farms in Botswana.

I'd always end up with one or two that I just could never see. When I want to do the same type of comparison between two directories on my computer, I use Directory Lister and I never miss a thing. Not only does Directory Lister display the contents of your chosen directories, it will also let you save the output to an HTML file. This is great for web developers who want a quick way to list the contents of a ZIP file before archiving it and uploading it to their website. As an added bonus, Directory Lister also shows the date, time, and attributes of the files in your directory, making it easier than ever to compare the differences in files between two directories.\n",

The same technique holds true for my normal browsing... for example, I can use Web Calendar to remind me to check out the Digital Media newsletter every morning, or to check Amazon for a CD that I know will be released in a week.

      "I am a sucker for keyboard shortcuts. Anything that can save me from using the mouse is good in my book. Occasionally I like to view the web or Windows Explorer in Full Screen mode... to do this I just hit F11 on the keyboard and there I am in Full Screen mode. Hit it again and I am back to regular mode. If you aren't as much of a fan of keyboard shortcuts as me, then all you have to do is press and hold the Ctrl key while clicking on the Maximize button and you will have the same effect. You will notice, however, that your Start Menu isn't anywhere to be seen. Never fear, another keyboard shortcut is here... just press Ctrl key plus the Esc key and your Start Menu will be back where it belongs. Alternatively, if you have a Windows key on your keyboard you can use that key to bring up your Start Menu as well.\n",

Not as potent as Shangrila Zowie Wowie from a smoking perspective (no legal product is), but well worth your attention! Many folks find that if they partake of both smoke and brew that not only do they go to sleep very happily, but that their dreaming life is often nicely enhanced.\n",

For the non-smoker, it is most appropriate to engage Capillaris Herba as a most peaceful brew/tea. (Steep approximately one teaspoon of Capillaris Herba per one cup of water for ten minutes or so & strain.) \n",

At the time, we felt that the advertising industry created a huge opportunity for the company's direct sourcing technology solutions, and so far the company has delivered. Although the company has raised just $2 million in the two years it has been developing its technology, it has increased revenues sources dramatically by opening a financial services division expanding the Live Media Marketplace expected revenues to $3-5 mm during fiscal 2003, driving the line in 2004 to $15- 25 mm. This remarkable growth becomes more understandable when one views the savings that its direct sourcing model generates for advertisers and retailers. The company saves advertising buyers up to 70% in costs dramatically increasing wholesale pricing effect, by saving time & efforts, cutting telephone and faxing bills, while providing free mass sourcing opportunities for negotiating advertising buying and selling opportunities using a secure state of the art real time negotiating technology over the Internet, weve never seen anything like it!\n",

But at each moment her mood changed; she was full of confidence or craft; her moving tenderness would give place to a heart-breaking hardness and insensibility. Yet how paint her as she was, without bringing together all the extremes of feminine nature? In a word, the Duchess was anything that she wished to be or to seem. Her face was slightly too long. There was a grace in it, and a certain thinness and fineness that recalled the portraits of the Middle Ages. Her skin was white, with a faint rose tint.

A moment after this, there was a knock at my door, and this same man entered. It was W----, the poet of nature, who is only a poor tailor, but who has a truly poetical mind. Rellstab and others in Berlin have mentioned him with honor; there is something healthy in his poems, among which several of a sincerely religious character may be found. He had read that I was in Berlin, and wished now to visit me. We sat together on the sofa and conversed: there was such an amiable contentedness, such an unspoiled and good tone of mind about him, that I was sorry not to be rich in order that I might do something for him. I was ashamed of offering him the little that I could give; in any case I wished to put it in as agreeable a form as I could. I asked him whether I might invite him to hear Jenny Lind.  -->\n",

I can shut down, or reboot without any problems, but logout does nothing.  I don't know if this started after the full-upgrade that I did last Monday (which caused other LXDE problems) or not, as I don't think I had tried to do a logout on this system before then.  This isn't a big issue, as it is on my laptop, on which I am the only user and I am usually either logged in and working, or the system is shut down.  I am primarily worried that this is a symptom of some other problem that I have not yet noticed.  Any ideas what could be causing this?\n",

      "What is MIME?\n",
      "\n",
      "MIME stands for \"Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions\".  It is the\n",
      "standard for how to send multipart, multimedia, and binary data using the\n",
      "world-wide Internet email system.  Typical uses of MIME include sending\n",
      "images, audio, wordprocessing documents, programs, or even plain text\n",
      "files when it is important that the mail system does not modify any part\n",
      "of the file.  MIME also allows for labelling message parts so that a\n",
      "recipient (or mail program) may determine what to do with them. \n",
      "\n",
      "How can I read a MIME message?\n",
      "\n",
      "Since MIME is only a few years old, there are still some mailers in use\n",
      "which do not understand MIME messages.  However, there are a growing\n",
      "number of mail programs that have MIME support built-in.  (One popular\n",
      "MIME-capable mailer for Unix, VMS and PCs is Pine, developed at the\n",
      "University of Washington and available via anonymous FTP from the host\n",
      "ftp.cac.washington.edu in the file /pine/pine.tar.Z)\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, several proprietary email systems provide MIME translation\n",
      "capability in their Internet gateway products.  However, even if you do\n",
      "not have access to a MIME-capable mailer or suitable gateway, there is\n",
      "still hope! \n",
      "\n",
      "There are a number of stand-alone programs that can interpret a MIME\n",
      "message.  One of the more versatile is called \"munpack\".  It was developed\n",
      "at Carnegie Mellon University and is available via anonymous FTP from the\n",
      "host ftp.andrew.cmu.edu in the directory pub/mpack/.  There are versions\n",
      "available for Unix, PC, Mac and Amiga systems.  For compabibility with\n",
      "older forms of transferring binary files, the munpack program can also\n",
      "decode messages in split-uuencoded format. \n",
      "\n",
      "Does MIME replace UUENCODE?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes.  UUENCODE has been used for some time for encoding binary files so\n",
      "that they can be sent via Internet mail, but it has several technical\n",
      "limitations and interoperability problems.  MIME uses a more robust\n",
      "encoding called \"Base64\" which has been carefully designed to survive the\n",
      "message transformations made by certain email gateways. \n",
      "\n",
      "How can I learn more about MIME?\n",
      "\n",

      "  Sun Micro Outlines Roadmap for Managing Networks \n",
      "  Friday September 20, 5:00 am ET \n",
      "  By Peter Henderson \n",
      "\n",
      "  SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Computer maker Sun Microsystems Inc. on Thursday\n",
      "  said it would create in a few years a network environment that will be as\n",
      "  straightforward to handle as a single machine, a strategy it calls N1.\n",
      "\n",
      "  It laid out a road map for a new layer of intelligent software and systems that will meld\n",
      "  unwieldy networks into easy-to-use systems, a goal similar to those of most rivals\n",
      "  making computers which manage networks. \n",
      "  EMC Corp. announced this week software aimed at allowing users to manage storage\n",
      "  resources as a pool. Hewlett-Packard Co has a Utility Data Center, designed for\n",
      "  broader management. International Business Machines Corp's project eLiza is working\n",
      "  to make computers \"self-healing\" when systems break.\n",
      "\n",
      "  \"Applications still have to run zeroes and ones on some computing engine but the\n",
      "  whole idea behind N1 is you stop thinking about that. You don't think about what box\n",
      "  it is running on,\" Sun Vice President Steve MacKay, head of the N1 program, said in an\n",
      "  interview on the sidelines of a Sun user conference. \n",
      "\n",
      "  Many industry executives see computer power eventually being sold like power or\n",
      "  water, as a utility that can be turned on or off, in whatever volume one wants whenever\n",
      "  needed. \n",
      "  For that to happen computers must be tied together seamlessly, rather than cobbling\n",
      "  them together with tenuous links, as most networks do today, experts say. There are\n",
      "  still major barriers, though, such as communications standards for machines from\n",
      "  different vendors to interoperate closely. \n",
      "  Sun promised to deliver a \"virtualization engine\" that would let administrators look at\n",
      "  their entire network as a pool by the end of the year. Network administrators today\n",
      "  often have no automatic system to report what is in the network. \n",
      "\n",
      "  \"It'll tell you what you have and how it is laid out,\" promised MacKay\n",
      "  The second stage, beginning in 2003, would allow users to identify a service, such as\n",
      "  online banking, and allocate resources for them with a few clicks, Sun said. \n",
      "  Finally, in 2004, Sun's software should allow networks to change uses of resources on\n",
      "  the fly in response to changing needs, such as a bank assuring quicker online response\n",
      "  time for priority users, the company said.\n",

      " \n",
      " The time for elevenses in Britain - perhaps the opportunity for a quiet cup of\n",
      " tea and a chocolate Hobnob - is known in Russia as the Wolf Hour.\n",
      " \n",
      " It was so named in Soviet times because at 11am a wolf appeared from the\n",

      " opening time in the nation's vodka shops.\n",
      " \n",
      " And the vodka, like all other spirits, is cheap. Kommersant pointed out that\n",

      " \n",

      " that drop below -70C. Houses are built on concrete stilts because the\n",
      " permafrost makes digging foundations impossible.\n",
      " \n",
      " Again, the Russian paper had a word of reassurance. While acknowledging the\n",

      " solve itself\".\n",
      " \n",

      "       Socijalisticka partija Srbije, predvodjena grupom starih socijalista na celu sa Milomirem Minicem, konacno se odrekla politike i herojskog drzanja predsednika te stranke Slobodana Milosevica, saopstenjima, da jedan ,,slabo obavesten covek ne moze, pogotovu ne iz zatvorske celije upravljati tako velikom partijom kao sto je Socijalisticka partija Srbije, pa zvao se on i Slobodan Milosevic''.\n",
      "       Socijalisti koji za sebe danas kazu da vise nisu idolopoklonici Slobodana Milosevica, neprestano, u kontaktima sa clanovima i simpatizerima te partije, pokusavaju da razdvoje odbranu Slobodana Milosevica u Hagu, od politickog zivota u Srbiji, pripisujuci Milosevicevim braniocima iz nacionalnog komiteta za oslobadjanje S. Milosevica, ,,Sloboda'' da im je cilj da uniste Socijalisticku partiju Srbije.\n",
      "        Iako je zbog istih takvih gledista, svojevremeno najpolularniji socijalista, posle predsednika te stranke, prof. Branislav Ivkovic bio iskljucen iz redova SPS, danas rukovodstvo SPS koristi jos teze i grublje kvalifikacije na racun njihovog predsednika, pritom ne strahujuci da bi bilo ko od njih mogao biti iskljucen iz partije.\n",
      "        Ne retko se poslednjih dana, u rokovodstvu partije cuje da partija nije Slobodan Milosevic, i da on ne predstvalja tu partiju, vec da su partija Rukovodstvo i Glavni odbor te stranke.\n",
      "        Medjutim u clanstvu i medju simpatizerima te stranke, stvari se ne odijaju bas po planovima rukovodstva.\n",
      "        Procene idu dotle da se na septembarskim izborima ocekuje da Bata Zivojinovic osvoji tek 1% glasova.  Clanovi partije, najveci deo njih i danas veruje svom heroju, Slobodanu Milosevicu.\n",
      "        Po clanstvu partije, ovih dana u rukovodstvu partije, oni koji su predsednika te stranke pogresno informisali poslednjih godina, kada su shvatili da im je ,,odzvonilo'' pokusavaju da sacuvaju sebe eliminacijom predsednika Slobodana Milosevica.\n",
      "        Mladi socijalisti, kojih i nema bas mnogo, kako se SPS svojevremeno hvalio, izgleda su na strani predsednika te stranke. Tako se u nastupima na opstinskim odborima, mogu cuti uverljivi govori Dejana Stjepanovica i Igora Raicevica, i po neki Milinka Isakovica iz redova mladih socijalista, clanova organizaciono politickog odbora predsednika SPS. \n",
      "        Obracanja ovih mladih ljudi, medju clanstvom partije imaju do deset puta vecu tezuni, nego li obracanja profesionalnih politicara koji za sobom vuku teret proslosti.\n",
      "         Stav rukovodstva mladih socijalista, se razlikuje od stava saveta mladih, koji su takodje na strani predsednika. \n",
      "         Branko Ruzic i Dejan Backovic, svojevremeno najveci branioci i zastupnici lika i dela Slobodana Milosevica, danas su se pretvorili u njegove najvece kriticare. Pokusavaju na sve moguce nacine da minorizuju grupu mladih koja ga podrzava.\n",
      "         Cak se poslednjih dana cuje, da je najbolji recept da se rukovodstvo mladih odrzi ikao je protiv Sloba, da se povezu rodbinskim vezama, pa se tako predsednik mladih socijalista Beograda, Ana Djurovic udala za Branka Ruzica, predsednika Mladih socijalista Srbije, koji je za kuma uzeo Dejna Backovia, svog potpredsednika. Backovic se ovih dana zeni, jednom  mladom socijalistkinjom koja je clan saveta mladih, a u isto vreme i sestra jednog od clanova IO GO SPS-a, za kuma uzima jos jednog mladog socijalistu iz Saveta mladih.

He might be in time for that, after seeing Mrs. Branston.

There had been a final rupture between Adela and Mrs. Pallinson a few days before, and that matron, having shown her cards a little too plainly, had been routed by an unwonted display of spirit on the part of the pretty little widow. She was gone, carrying all her belongings with her, and leaving peace and liberty behind her. The flush of triumph was still upon Mrs. Branston; and this unexpected victory, brief and sudden in its occurrence, like most great victories, was almost a consolation to her for that disappointment which had stricken her so heavily of late.  -->\n",

For example, an American newspaper correspondent had written a dramatic description of the German army marching, marching steadily along a great Belgian high road--a procession without beginning and without end--and of the procession being halted for his benefit, and of a German officer therein who struck a soldier several times in the face angrily with his cane, while the man stood stiffly at attention.

During the skirmish, which will last more time than you think for, some of us ought to go back and fetch the National Guard and the militia from Fougeres.   What could it all mean? Why that medium for her message? Should he write and ask her? But what was there to ask or say, in the face of her silence? Besides, he had not even her address.

      "He belonged to that small minority of undemonstrative retiring natures, who are always at peace with themselves, and who are conscious of a feeling of humiliation at the mere thought of making a request, no matter what its nature may be. So promotion had come to him tardily, and by virtue of the slowly-working laws of seniority. He had been made a sub-lieutenant in 1802, but it was not until 1829 that he became a major, in spite of the grayness of his moustaches. His life had been so blameless that no man in the army, not even the general himself, could approach him without an involuntary feeling of respect. It is possible that he was not forgiven for this indisputable superiority by those who ranked above him; but, on the other hand, there was not one of his men that did not feel for him something of the affection of children for a good mother. For them he knew how to be at once indulgent and severe. He himself had also once served in the ranks, and knew the sorry joys and gaily-endured hardships of the soldier's lot. He knew the errors that may be passed over and the faults that must be punished in his men--his children, as he always called them--and when on campaign he readily gave them leave to forage for provision for man and horse among the wealthier classes.  Master Pillsbury pursed his lips and his expression became severe.  Yes, I shall outlive it, else I should have little faith in myself. But I shall not forget; and if you would remain forever what you now are to me, you will so act that nothing may mar this memory, if it is to be no more. I doubt your power to forget an affection which has survived so many changes and withstood assaults such as Geoffrey must unconsciously have made upon it. But I have no right to condemn your beliefs, to order your actions, or force you to accept my code of morals if you are not ready for it. You must decide, but do not again deceive yourself, and through whatever comes hold fast to that which is better worth preserving than husband, happiness, or friend.  What's the price, asked Ellis, of the cigar and the compliment together? In other words, what do you want of me? \n",

      " by a new destroyer--a gentlemanly vulture, whose suave accents and perfect manners were fatal to the unwary. Henceforth Horatio Cromie Nugent Paget flourished and fattened upon the folly of his fellow-men. As promoter of joint-stock companies that never saw the light; as treasurer of loan-offices where money was never lent; as a gentleman with capital about to introduce a novel article of manufacture from the sale of which a profit of five thousand a year would infallibly be realized, and desirous to meet with another gentleman of equal capital; as the mysterious X.Y.Z. who will--for so small a recompense as thirty postage-stamps--impart the secret of an elegant and pleasing employment, whereby seven-pound-ten a-week may be made by any individual, male or female;--under every flimsy disguise with which the swindler hides his execrable form, Captain Paget plied his cruel trade, and still contrived to find fresh dupes. Of course there were occasions when the pigeons were slow to flutter into the fascinating snare, and when the vulture had a bad time of it; and it was a common thing for the Captain to sink from the splendour of Mayfair or St. James's-street into some dingy transpontine hiding-place. But he never went back to Tulliver's-terrace, though Mary Anne pleaded piteously for the payment of her poor mother's debt. When her husband was in funds, he patted her head affectionately, and told her that he would see about it--i.e. the payment of Mrs. Kepp's bill; while, if she ventured to mention the subject to him when his purse was scantily furnished, he would ask her fiercely how he was to satisfy her mother's extortionate claims when he had not so much as a sixpence for his own use. \n",

      "<code>ArrayList</code> and <code>LinkedList</code> are two <code>Collections</code> classes used for storing lists of object references. For example, you could have an <code>ArrayList</code> of Strings, or a <code>LinkedList</code> of Integers. This tip compares the performance of <code>ArrayList</code> and <code>LinkedList</code>, and offers some suggestions about which of these classes is the right choice in a given situation.\n",

Because of that, an <code>ArrayList</code> is much faster than a <code>LinkedList</code> for random access, that is, when accessing arbitrary list elements using the <code>get</code> method. Note that the <code>get</code> method is implemented for <code>LinkedLists</code>, but it requires a sequential scan from the front or back of the list. This scan is very slow. For a <code>LinkedList</code>, there's no fast way to access the Nth element of the list.\n",

If the middle value is too high, then the upper half of the list is eliminated. However, if the middle value is too low, then the lower half of the list is ignored. This process continues until the key is found in the list, or until the lower bound of the search becomes greater than the upper bound.\n",

      "of the story I told in last week's issue. James Woodfield pointed\n",
      "out that there is another possible explanation. In medieval Latin,\n",
      "the ventricles of the heart were at times called \"cochleae cordis\",\n",
      "where the second word is derived from \"cor\", heart. Those unversed\n",
      "in Latin could have misinterpreted \"cochleae\" as \"cockles\". Oddly,\n",
      "\"cochlea\" in Latin means \"snail\" (from the shape of the ventricles\n",
      "- it's also the name of the spiral cavity of the inner ear), so if\n",

      "word is the one that is most common in online searches, where the\n",
      "Canadian focus is also obvious. Cheryl Caesar noted that it appears\n",

      "particularly one attached to the bottom corner of a sail (it comes\n",
      "from an Old English term for the corner of a sail). The sheets were\n",
      "vital, since they trimmed the sail to the wind. If they ran loose,\n",

      "Lower Manhattan. \n",
      "\n",
      "Amassed during the initial stages of a complicated\n",
      "insurance lawsuit involving the trade center, the\n",

      "developed by some of the nation's most respected\n",
      "engineering minds. It includes computer calculations that\n",
      "have produced a series of three-dimensional images of the\n",
      "crumpled insides of the towers after the planes hit,\n",
      "helping to identify the sequence of failures that led to\n",
      "the collapses. \n",
      "\n",
      "An immense body of documentary evidence, like maps of the\n",
      "debris piles, rare photos and videos, has also been\n",
      "accumulated in a collection that far outstrips what\n",
      "government analysts have been able to put together as they\n",
      "struggle to answer the scientifically complex and\n",
      "emotionally charged questions surrounding the deadly\n",
      "failures of the buildings. \n",
      "\n",
      "But everyone from structural engineers to relatives of\n",
      "victims fear that the closely held information, which\n",
      "includes the analysis and the possible answers that\n",
      "families and engineers around the world have craved, may\n",
      "remain buried in sealed files, or even destroyed. \n",
      "\n",
      "Bound by confidentiality agreements with their clients, the\n",
      "experts cannot disclose their findings publicly as they\n",
      "wait for the case to play out. Such restrictions are\n",
      "typical during the discovery phase of litigation. And as it\n",
      "now stands, the judge in the case - who has agreed that\n",
      "certain material can remain secret for the time being - has\n",

      "Larry A. Silverstein, whose companies own a lease on the\n",
      "trade center property, and a consortium of insurance\n",
      "companies. Mr. Silverstein maintains that each jetliner\n",
      "that hit the towers constituted a separate terrorist\n",

      "that amount, as the insurance companies say. \n",
      "\n",
      "As both sides have prepared their arguments, they have\n",
      "spent hundreds of thousands of dollars acquiring expert\n",

      "that are keeping those out of the public domain today.\" He\n",
      "conceded that differing opinions among the more than 20\n",
      "insurers on his side of the case could complicate any\n",

      "\n",
      "As for his own company, whose consultants alone have\n",
      "produced more than 1,700 pages of analysis and thousands of\n",
      "diagrams and photographs, Mr. Davison said every attempt\n",
      "would be made to give the material eventually to \"public\n",
      "authorities and investigative teams.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "Still, some of that analysis relies on information like\n",

      "the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which built\n",
      "and owned the trade center and supports Mr. Silverstein in\n",
      "the suit. Mr. Davison said he was uncertain how the\n",
      "differing origins of the material would influence his\n",
      "company's ability to release information. \n",
      "\n",
      "In a statement, the Port Authority said access to documents\n",
      "would be \"decided on a case-by-case basis consistent with\n",

      "\n",
      "The fate of the research is particularly critical to\n",
      "resolve unanswered questions about why the towers fell,\n",
      "given the dissatisfaction with the first major inquiry into\n",
      "the buildings' collapse. That investigation, led by the\n",
      "Federal Emergency Management Agency, was plagued by few\n",
      "resources, a lack of access to crucial information like\n",
      "building plans, and infighting among experts and officials.\n",
      "A new federal investigation intended to remedy those\n",

      "in discussions with Mr. Silverstein on the material, but\n",
      "said no transfer had taken place. \n",
      "\n",
      "With no shortage of money or expertise, investigations by\n",
      "both sides in the legal case have produced a startling body\n",
      "of science and theory, some of it relevant not only to the\n",
      "trade center disaster but to other skyscrapers as well. \n",

      "Mr. Levine said that because of the presumed value of the\n",
      "information, the court might look favorably on requests to\n",
      "make it public. But the uncertainty over the fate of the\n",

      "not piecemeal disclosures by litigants eager to protect\n",

      "The scope of the investigation behind the scenes is vast by\n",
      "any measure. Mr. Levy and his colleagues at Weidlinger\n",
      "Associates, hired by Silverstein Properties, have called\n",
      "upon powerful computer programs, originally developed with\n",
      "the Pentagon for classified research, to create a model of\n",
      "the Sept. 11 attack from beginning to end. \n",
      "\n",
      "The result is a compilation of three-dimensional images of\n",
      "the severed exterior columns, smashed floor and damaged\n",
      "core of the towers, beginning with the impacts and\n",
      "proceeding up to the moments of collapse. Those images -\n",
      "which Mr. Levy is not allowed to release - have helped\n",
      "pinpoint the structural failures. \n",
      "\n",
      "The FEMA investigators did not have access to such computer\n",
      "modeling. Nor did the FEMA team have unfettered access to\n",

      "immediately after the attacks. But no such constraints\n",

You are aware that my son, your nephew Philippe, lies under accusation of a capital offence in consequence of his devotion to the Emperor. Therefore you can hardly be surprised if a widow, compelled to take a humble situation in a lottery-office for a living, should come to seek consolation from those among whom she was born. \n",

No officer of justice has ever succeeded in arresting le Colonel Caoutchouc, as we call him in French. He is as slippery as an eel, that man. He wriggles through our fingers. Suppose even we caught him, what could we prove? I ask you. Nobody who has seen him once can ever swear to him again in his next impersonation. He is impayable, this good Colonel. On the day when I arrest him, I assure you, monsieur, I shall consider myself the smartest police-officer in Europe. \n",

This station was more than two miles distant, a long, straight walk by the river, and then a mile or so across fields and by narrow lanes to an arid spot, where some newly-built houses were arising round a hopeless-looking little loop-line station in a desert of agricultural land.  \n",

Henry kept close to the southern shore, his body often touching the soft earth. Fortunately the bushes grew thickly, even on the steep cliff, to the water's edge. When he had gone three or four hundred yards he pulled in among them and lay still awhile. He heard the sound of distant shots and he knew that the Indians were still sniping the camp. The curve of the Ohio hid the boats of his friends, and before him the river seemed to be deserted. Yet he was sure that the Indian canoes were on watch. They might be hovering within fifty yards of him.  \n",

      "A murmur came from the group of Chouans, and it was easy to see that the authority of the new chief was about to be disputed. The young man, on whom this effect of his words was by no means lost, was thinking of the best means of maintaining the dignity of his command, when the trot of a horse was heard in the vicinity. All heads turned in the direction from which the sound came. A lady appeared, sitting astride of a little Breton horse, which she put at a gallop as soon as she saw the young leader, so as to reach the group of Chouans as quickly as possible.  Good! and what risks do you not run by not believing? But let us talk of the worldly aspect of the matter, which most appeals to you. The finger of God is visible in human affairs; see how He directs them by the hand of His vicar on earth. How much men have lost by leaving the path traced out for them by Christianity! So few think of reading Church history, that erroneous notions deliberately sown among the people lead them to condemn the Church; yet the Church has been a pattern of perfect government such as men seek to establish to-day. The principle of election made it for a long while the great political power. Except the Catholic Church, there was no single religious institution which was founded upon liberty and equality. Everything was ordered to this end. The father-superior, the abbot, the bishop, the general of an order, and the pope were then chosen conscientiously for their fitness for the requirements of the Church. They were the expression of its intelligence, of the thinking power of the Church, and blind obedience was therefore their due. I will say nothing of the ways in which society has benefited by that power which has created modern nations and has inspired so many poems, so much music, so many cathedrals, statues, and pictures. I will simply call your attention to the fact that your modern systems of popular election, of two chambers, and of juries all had their origin in provincial and oecumenical councils, and in the episcopate and college of cardinals; but there is this difference,--the views of civilization held by our present-day philosophy seem to me to fade away before the sublime and divine conception of Catholic communion, the type of a universal social communion brought about by the word and the fact that are combined in religious dogma. It would be very difficult for any modern political system, however perfect people may think it, to work once more such miracles as were wrought in those ages when the Church as the stay and support of the human intellect.  It isn't that. But you've never carried baskets, Judge.  Gustave pondered. Yes, there were many lodgings, he informed the lady. And then he thought of Madame Magnotte. Was it not his duty to secure this stray lodger for that worthy woman, if possible? \n",

What the forces to the west are I don't know but the enemy in face of the general himself on the Potomac must now number at least ten thousand. \n",

A reader brought to my attention that, though he didn't believe it to be the case, offering my opinion on the state of America could be seen as trolling. That certainly wasn't intended. Also, I've seen much email over the past week that started with, \"Since you published the opinion of someone outside the US, I'd expect that you'll publish an opinion in disagreement.\" Well, I did that already - it was my own opinion that started the discussion. I can clearly see the potential for this to get out of hand. So, this will be the last word on the subject. Thanks for your opinions and your discussion, the vast majority of which was well-thought and reasonable. Both sides were presented and we're moving on.<p>\n",

If purchased as a bundle, both CrossOver Office and <a href=\"http://codeweavers.com/products/crossover/\" target=\"_blank\">CrossOver Plugin</a> (as we discussed yesterday) share an install script. They do, however, require separate install processes, so they need to be launched individually from a shared window.<p>\n",
      "\n",
      "I started the CrossOver Office install, dropped my Office 2000 disc in the CD drive, and fired up the install. It looked and performed exactly as you'd expect to see it in Windows. I was able to customize the install, as I always have, then let it run. At the end of the process, CrossOver Office \"fakes\" a Windows reboot and the Office suite installation is complete.<p>\n",
      "\n",
      "Even Internet Explorer 5.0 is installed. There's an option in the CrossOver Office package to install IE 5.5 but, to my chagrin, this was the one area of the install that failed. Actually, the install itself may have succeeded - I was just left without an IE browser following the upgrade. It's hard to tell whether that was a fault in CrossOver Office, or in the IE program itself.<p>\n",
      "\n",
      "For the most part, these apps perform in Linux as they do in Windows. The IE install was a bit kludgy, with some font problems and an inability to customize the toolbar. Word worked perfectly, allowing me even to pull together legal documents for a friend's business without so much as a hiccup. Even printing works well with the installation of a \"Wine Postscript Printer\" driver.<p>\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me reiterate something I said yesterday. I've watched the Wine Project walk, then crawl, then walk again over the past few years. I've always suspected that the fits and starts were not for lack of talent. With the financial backing of CodeWeavers, it appears that my suspicions were well founded. Wine has, through CrossOver Office and CrossOver Plugin, matured to a level of useability that should easily attract Linux users throughout the spectrum of experience. In the big picture, widespread acceptance of these products could remove the last remaining roadblock for many current Windows users to make the leap to Linux: the loss of Word and Excel. They simply don't need to fear those losses any more.<p>\n",
      "\n",
      "A note on the \"for pay\" structure of these products seems in order. As you well know, I'm an open source guy through and through. But, this is clearly a case in which the \"free\" efforts of talented and dedicated developers simply wasn't enough to close the gap. The value of these products easily outweighs their minimal cost. And, if it keeps these developers moving forward, it seems to be the perfect pay model for Linux.<p><p>\n",

      "\n",
      "There's really not much mystery to it. This section simply asks the question, \"Do you want plug and play support in the kernel?\" In other words, do you have all the PCI and ISA devices in your system that you'll ever need to have? If you're set solid with your current machine, there's no use to add the overhead of PnP to your system's kernel code, or as a loadable module. If, on the other hand, you've got PCI or (on an older system) ISA slots just begging to be filled, build this support into the kernel or select it as modules.<p>\n",
      "\n",
      "See, this kernel gig isn't really so tough. In fairness, we're hitting the high points without a heady discussion of the hidden workings. The discussion of PnP alone could comprise a full series in Penguin Shell. But, so far, the configuration has been pretty straightforward.<p>\n",

Also, I've seen much email over the past week that started with, \"Since you published the opinion of someone outside the US, I'd expect that you'll publish an opinion in disagreement.\" Well, I did that already - it was my own opinion that started the discussion. I can clearly see the potential for this to get out of hand. So, this will be the last word on the subject. Thanks for your opinions and your discussion, the vast majority of which was well-thought and reasonable. Both sides were presented and we're moving on.<p>\n",

      "\n",
      "I don't want to mince any words, here. <a href=\"http://www.codeweavers.com/ target=\"_blank\">CodeWeavers</a> has really hit a sweet spot with their recently-released <a href=\"http://codeweavers.com/products/office/\" target=\"_blank\">CrossOver Office</a> product. This is, quite simply, the fulfillment of the promise of the <a href=\"http://wine.codeweavers.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Wine Project</a>. Using this slick little app, virtually all the applications in the Microsoft Office suite are fully functional in Linux. Frankly, I never thought I'd see the day when running Windows apps in Linux was exciting. Maybe it's time to take up shucking ice cubes in the blasted lands.<p>\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's break this product up a bit. If purchased as a bundle, both CrossOver Office and <a href=\"http://codeweavers.com/products/crossover/\" target=\"_blank\">CrossOver Plugin</a> (as we discussed yesterday) share an install script. They do, however, require separate install processes, so they need to be launched individually from a shared window.<p>\n",
      "\n",
      "I started the CrossOver Office install, dropped my Office 2000 disc in the CD drive, and fired up the install. It looked and performed exactly as you'd expect to see it in Windows. I was able to customize the install, as I always have, then let it run. At the end of the process, CrossOver Office \"fakes\" a Windows reboot and the Office suite installation is complete.<p>\n",
      "\n",
      "Even Internet Explorer 5.0 is installed. There's an option in the CrossOver Office package to install IE 5.5 but, to my chagrin, this was the one area of the install that failed. Actually, the install itself may have succeeded - I was just left without an IE browser following the upgrade. It's hard to tell whether that was a fault in CrossOver Office, or in the IE program itself.<p>\n",
      "\n",
      "For the most part, these apps perform in Linux as they do in Windows. The IE install was a bit kludgy, with some font problems and an inability to customize the toolbar. Word worked perfectly, allowing me even to pull together legal documents for a friend's business without so much as a hiccup. Even printing works well with the installation of a \"Wine Postscript Printer\" driver.<p>\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me reiterate something I said yesterday. I've watched the Wine Project walk, then crawl, then walk again over the past few years. I've always suspected that the fits and starts were not for lack of talent. With the financial backing of CodeWeavers, it appears that my suspicions were well founded. Wine has, through CrossOver Office and CrossOver Plugin, matured to a level of useability that should easily attract Linux users throughout the spectrum of experience. In the big picture, widespread acceptance of these products could remove the last remaining roadblock for many current Windows users to make the leap to Linux: the loss of Word and Excel. They simply don't need to fear those losses any more.<p>\n",
      "\n",
      "A note on the \"for pay\" structure of these products seems in order. As you well know, I'm an open source guy through and through. But, this is clearly a case in which the \"free\" efforts of talented and dedicated developers simply wasn't enough to close the gap. The value of these products easily outweighs their minimal cost. And, if it keeps these developers moving forward, it seems to be the perfect pay model for Linux.<p><p>\n",

      "\n",
      "There's really not much mystery to it. This section simply asks the question, \"Do you want plug and play support in the kernel?\" In other words, do you have all the PCI and ISA devices in your system that you'll ever need to have? If you're set solid with your current machine, there's no use to add the overhead of PnP to your system's kernel code, or as a loadable module. If, on the other hand, you've got PCI or (on an older system) ISA slots just begging to be filled, build this support into the kernel or select it as modules.<p>\n",
      "\n",
